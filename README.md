# TrinityTicTacToe

The game is played between 2 players simultaneously on 3 Tic Tac Toe boards. However, this version of Tic Tac Toe has a twist.

● Both players will only be marking crosses(X) on all the three boards. As soon as a board gets three X’s in a row, column or diagonal, it will be cancelled and the players won’t be allowed to make a move on it thereafter.

● 2 boards will be cancelled in this manner and the winner will be decided on the basis of the 3rd board. The last player who is able to put a mark on the 3rd board in such a way that three X’s in a row, column or diagonal are NOT achieved, will be the winner.

● In other words, the player who will complete three X’s in a row, column or diagonal on the 3rd board will lose the game.
